#### **In brief**

- The Abandoibarra district is a redevelopment of an obsolete and run-down port area adjacent to the River Nervion.
- The relocation of the port from the city centre opened up the waterfront as a key area of transformation.
- The recuperation of the river is accompanied by a series of landmark infrastructures, such as the Guggenheim Museum, Euskalduna Conference and Concert Hall, a maritime museum, 600 luxury housing units, offices, shopping and leisure centre, shops, university facilities, hotels and green areas including a 3 kilometres pedestrian promenade.
- The project brought about the transition of Bilbao from an industrial city to a city of services and culture.

#### **Key issues faced before the implementation of the project**

- Decline of mining, steel and shipbuilding industries, which conditioned the urban structure along the river.
- Rising unemployment of about 22.5% in the 1970s and 1980s, due to deindustrialisation and disinvestment both from abroad and other parts of Spain.
- Negative environmental impact on the river from industries and port activities.
