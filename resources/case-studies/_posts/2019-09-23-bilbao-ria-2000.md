***How did Bilbao continue to transform itself over the years despite changes in its leadership? The answer lies in an institutionalised process through a private non-profit entity known as Bilbao Ria 2000.

#### **In brief**

- Bilbao Ria 2000 is a publicly-funded private firm comprising of several public shareholders, namely the government, ministries, several public agencies and private enterprises.
- It coordinates and executes projects related to town planning, transportation and the environment, focusing on the urban directives drawn up by the planning authorities.
- The non-profit entity has, since 1992, taken a lead role in the redevelopment of the metropolitan region and continues to support current and proposed initiatives for the city’s future.

#### **Key issues faced before the implementation of the project**

- Decline of mining, steel and shipbuilding industries, which conditioned the urban structure along the river.
- Rising unemployment of about 22.5% in the 1970s and 80s, due to deindustrialisation and disinvestment both from abroad and other parts of Spain.
- Negative environmental impact on the river from industries and port activities.

#### **Leadership and governance**

- Bilbao benefited from successive mayors who saw through the urban initiatives that transformed the city. Bilbao Ria 2000 was initiated by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Environment (currently Ministry of Development), and established by the late Dr Inaki Azkuna (mayor of Bilbao from 1999-2014) in 1992, who assumed the role as chairman, during his appointment as Health Councillor of the Basque Government.
- The ownership structure comprises the Housing Ministry (25%), Bilbao Port Authority (10%), Railway companies (15%), Basque Government (15%), Biscayan Provincial Government (15%), Bilbao City Council (15%), and Barakaldo City Council (5%).
- As stakeholders, they are represented by high-level board members. The agreement by consensus is institutionalised as a process to mandate land development, which will be affected less by political inclinations, and thus ensure long-term plans.
- For development process, Bilbao Ria 200 consolidates land, transfers the stakeholders’ developmental rights, prepares the land, lays out the infrastructure, and sells the land for development.

#### **Creativity and innovation**

- Abandoibarra demonstrated that the use of culture, internationalisation and design excellence as key catalysts have enabled the successful regeneration of the city. Through constant re-invention and evolvement, the city progressed from an industrial to a knowledge-based economy.
- Bilbao Guggenheim Museum – the symbol of transformation. It played an outstanding role as a driving force for shifting Bilbao’s personality towards a more cosmopolitan character with a closer relationship to contemporary culture.
- Euskalduna Palace Conference and Music Centre – the second building built in the area after Guggenheim Museum. It was designed in weathering steel as a symbol of the last vessel built in the old Euskalduna shipyard, which had occupied the space for decades.
- Avenida de Abandoibarra – a major avenue and backbone of the area. The carriageways are separated by a 12-metre wide, tree-lined and grassed central reservation on which the tram runs.
- Bank Park – a facility to connect existing promenades along 800 metres of the waterfront. The city reclaimed almost 6 kilometres of leisure space on both sides of the river. The park features the collection of sculptures, a kind of ‘Memory Lane’ to commemorate the intense industrial activity which used to be the main feature on site.
- Auskalduna Bridge, Zubizuri Footbridge and Pedro Arrupe Walkway – bridges and walkway that foster communications between both sides of the river. They are physical infrastructures for social interaction, as well as sculptures that strengthen the image of innovation and modernity.

- The Bilbao effect or Guggenheim effect – it is not just about achieving urban transformation, economic and social vibrancy through a few iconic buildings. Rather, it is about a strong leadership and a commitment to a systematic and long term plan, based on solid processes and supporting infrastructure.
- Strong boost for tourist sector since the inauguration of Guggenheim Museum in 1997, attracting an average of 1 million visitors per year since its opening.
- Airport passengers increased from 1.4 million in 1994 to 3.8 million in 2005.
Guggenheim Museum has maintained 3,816 jobs during the first year, and increased to 4,232 jobs (or 10.9% increase) in the year 2006.
- The urban regeneration attracts private sector investment. The large energy company Iberdrola has decided to build its new headquarter on the site. The Iberdrola Tower has become the new financial and business icon of Bilbao.
- The number of conference delegates arriving in the city increased tenfold to 178,000 per year.

#### **Replicable ideas**

- A city can be regenerated through the use of culture, internationalisation and design excellence.
- The vision should not only focus on economic growth, but also look at the social and quality of life considerations.
- Abandoibarra serves as a reference in terms of strategic vision and good governance. It constitutes an inspirational source for other cities with underprivileged areas of great potential. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
