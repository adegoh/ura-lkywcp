When the much-anticipated High Line opened in New York City in 2009, its success story sparked intense interest across cities worldwide, spawning a number of similar projects. With over five million visitors a year, the High Line has revitalised a largely ignored neighbourhood in Manhattan, created economic benefits in terms of tax revenue, increased property value and some 12,000 jobs, and demonstrated the impact of good urban design and strong private-public partnerships1. Gains aside, one of the most distinguishing features of the High Line lies in the fact that it is an elevated park coursing through the city, challenging the traditional notion of landed public parks.

This idea, however, of utilising space above existing urban infrastructure for parks is not new. As early as 1950, New York had built the iconic Brooklyn Heights Promenade, a tree-lined pedestrian walkway over an expressway. Freeway caps serving as parks have also been built over the past decades in a number of American cities. But it is only in the 1990s that the current trend of elevated parks began when Paris inaugurated the Promenade Plantée in 1993.

Stretching 4.7 km over disused 19th century railway infrastructure, Promenade Plantée was the inspiration behind New York’s adaptive re-use of the High Line2, with key proponents for the High Line visiting Paris on study trips to understand how they could improve on the design. An elevated linear park, the project also integrates specialised commercial establishments and cycling pathways. In a way, Promenade Plantée is a product of urban design concerns and challenges of its time – the rising push for pedestrian-friendly cities and human-scaled design, competition for urban space among different stakeholders in cities, and the tensions between preserving older disused infrastructure versus redevelopment.
