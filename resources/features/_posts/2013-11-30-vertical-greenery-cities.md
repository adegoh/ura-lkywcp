***Vertical greenery is increasingly used in cities to both raise quality of life and improve urban environments and eco-systems. As well as modifying temperatures, improving air quality and increasing biodiversity, exposure to urban greenery can improve peoples’ physiology and mental health. Yet, how effective is vertical greenery, what are its costs and benefits, and how sustainable is it in the long term?***

In cities with finite land and increasing populations, green space is at a premium. In developing cities, greenfield sites are often turned over to housing rural-to-urban migrants, while real estate prices in most cities rise in proximity to parks and nature. This often results in demographic shifts within urban areas as gentrification drives the poorer classes into the city’s most built-up districts. In this context, what role does vertical greenery play in a city’s approach to socio-economic sustainability?

Vertical greenery is not new. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon was both a wonder of the world and a textbook example of integrating green space into a building’s aboveground superstructure. Today, vertical greenery could be any form of greenery on residential, commercial or industrial buildings’ walls, façades, rooftops, atriums, balconies or sky gardens.

The positive attributes of urban greenery are well established. But Dr Tan Puay Yok, Associate Professor at the Department of Architecture, School of Design and Environment, National University of Singapore, argues that vertical greenery can broadly be classified as having either “use value” or “non-use value”. The former refers to the direct usage of, or physical interaction with, the green space. For vertical greenery, this tends to occur only in residential buildings or those commercial buildings with public access.

Non-use value includes environmental benefits, such as vertical greenery reducing a building’s surface, ambient and radiant temperatures; increasing an urban area’s bio-diversity; and improving air quality. The non-use value of vertical greenery can also have positive economic and social effects, as it can increase a building’s rental value, or a green wall or rooftop garden can be aesthetically pleasing.
