After New York City’s traumatic experience in 2001, it rebuilt and became an even greener and greater city, earning itself the 2012 Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize. Now, with emerging technologies and trends such as digitalisation creating new opportunities and challenges, it is executing an ambitious vision to help it adapt and grow sustainably to the year 2050 and beyond. Its achievements and plans could point the way for other progressive cities.

Few cities have been as consistently visionary as New York City (NYC) in the United States. In the early 1800s, the city’s urban planners designed a street grid that would accommodate homes and businesses for one million residents when its population was just 100,000 people. After the city’s devastating experience in 2001, its government responded by not only rebuilding the damaged areas but also unveiling an ambitious new plan, called PlaNYC, in 2007 to make it an even greener and greater hub of the world. 

Under the plan, the city planted one million more trees to reduce its ambient temperature and slash its greenhouse gas emissions, converted disused and dilapidated sites such as the Hudson Yards and Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront into residential and commercial districts, and upgraded its energy infrastructure, including its power plants. In 2012, these and other efforts and achievements earned the city the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize. 

The Prize jury noted that the government had integrated land use planning, transportation investment, environmental stewardship and other disciplines to guide the city’s sustainable development to 2030. The authorities’ efforts also addressed how the city would cater for an additional one million residents, renew its ageing physical infrastructure and mitigate climate change and its impact. “The city’s transformation serves as an inspiring model for other mature, high-density global cities and offers many innovative and replicable solutions for cities around the world,” said the jury. 

Since then, the city has gone further to take advantage of emerging technologies and trends, such as the digitalisation of industries, and to limit their potential side effects, such as growing income inequality. In 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio introduced the One NYC 2050 plan, which builds on PlaNYC to shape the city up to 2050. He said: “We are pushing ourselves to fight global warming on every front, achieve equity, and build a city where everyone is welcomed in civic life. New York has been a beacon to the world, and we hope this plan will serve as an antidote to the challenges facing our city, our nation and the globe.”
