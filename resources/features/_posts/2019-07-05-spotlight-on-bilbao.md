***The inaugural Prize Laureate city of Bilbao is continuting to set a example through implementing a comprehensive flood protection plan to guard against climate change, a "green ring" project to boost residents' access to nature, a high-speed rail network, and the conversion of a derelict peninsula into a showcase for smart, sustainable and socially-equitable living.***

When the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize was inaugurated in 2010, the city of Bilbao in Spain was a compelling first winner. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city was struck by twin disasters: a worldwide economic crisis devastated its heavy industry economy, causing it to lose nearly half of its industrial jobs and more than one-tenth of its population, while a major flood destroyed large parts of it. Undeterred, its government drew up an ambitious plan to bring the city back from the brink, and successfully executed it over the next few decades. 

Among the government’s crowning achievements was the development of a publicly-owned organisation called Bilbao Ria 2000 to oversee the plan’s implementation. To ensure that the city’s rehabilitation would not stall for lack of financing, Bilbao Ria 2000 upgraded plots of public land, sold parts of them to private developers, and used the proceeds to revitalise other areas, creating a virtuous circle. In this way, the organisation also provided an effective way for the government, businesses and community to work in concert to rebuild the city. 

The government’s fiscal discipline for Bilbao Ria 2000 was also matched by a far-reaching vision for the city’s transformation. Over the years, for example, the Abandoibarra waterfront district, which consisted of unused and polluted land once occupied by shipyards and associated industries, was cleaned up and converted into the new heart of the city. The Port of Bilbao was relocated to free up more space, and a series of landmarks, including the world-renowned Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao Maritime Museum and Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, was erected to create a cultural mecca to attract tourists. 

At the same time, the government invested in critical infrastructure to modernise the city, including a new metro system and water sanitation system. “The success of Bilbao is largely attributed to its integrated and holistic approach to achieve economic, social and physical transformations. Its emphasis on environmental clean-up, use of culture, internationalisation and design, major improvements to its infrastructure, and restoration of its historic areas over some 25 years successfully rejuvenated the city,” said the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize’s jury. 

> “The crisis of our traditional industry and flooding was the beginning of the new Bilbao we relish today, the Bilbao of the Guggenheim Museum, and the Bilbao of the 21st century: a model of urban development based on sustainability, social justice and a focus on education, talent and innovation.”
