***The city of Surabaya in Indonesia has thrived over the past decade by putting its heritage and culture at the centre of its urban development plans. Ubiquitous informal settlements have been turned into vibrant homes and economic engines, longstanding villages into tourist attractions, and disreputable neighbourhoods into artistic estates. Its creative urban planning shows other cities how they too can preserve their past while improving their liveability, sustainability and economy.***

Life in the city of Surabaya, Indonesia, has been on an upswing for many of its citizens. In 2017, the international Gallup World Poll found that the city is one of the happiest in the world, and a large majority of its residents are satisfied with the schools, healthcare, water services, public transportation and safety in their neighbourhoods. 

The city’s ascent, backed by other statistics, is all the more remarkable for having been achieved in less than a decade, and without it becoming yet another metropolis filled with cookie-cutter skyscrapers and indistinguishable neighbourhoods. In fact, its government, led by Mayor Tri Rismaharini, has harnessed the city’s culture, heritage and history as key assets in its bold urban development plans. 

The government has modernised the city’s ubiquitous kampungs, which are informal, low-income housing areas, instead of demolishing them and displacing their households. It has turned dilapidated historical areas into tourist attractions to boost the economy, and partnered citizens and businesses to change neglected and vice-ridden neighbourhoods into vibrant estates that also serve as cultural showcases. 

With this inclusive and preservation-minded approach to development, the government has delivered both economic growth and a better life for residents, earning it accolades such as a Special Mention in the 2018 Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize honour roll. Mayor Rismaharini has said that she learned from the experiences of fast-growing cities in Asia and Europe that alienated their citizens. Here is what other cities can learn from Surabaya’s positive example. 

“Developing a city not only involves physical development, it is also about empowering people and making them feel at home.”

Capitalising on culture 
With kampungs taking up about 60 percent of Surabaya’s land, replacing them would have been costly, time-consuming, and potentially ruinous to their low-income residents. Instead, Mayor Rismaharini’s government built on the Kampung Improvement Programme carried out in the 1970s to 1990s that provided the settlements with better footpaths, roads, drainage, and water infrastructure. It added new lighting and erected more amenities, including libraries to encourage education, and football fields and playgrounds for recreation. 

More critically, the government spearheaded two new projects, called Pahlawan Ekonomi (Economy Hero) and Kampung Unggulan (Prominent Kampung), to help the kampungs’ housewives earn an income. “The husbands were working but the families were still poor. We wanted to empower the housewives to counter Surabaya’s poverty problem,” Mayor Rismaharini told Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority in a recent interview. 

Under the Economy Hero programme, the housewives receive free professional training to improve the food and handicrafts that they are already making, with an eye to selling the products. The government also helps them to apply for capital, learn how to package the products attractively, sell the items at souvenir centres, malls, supermarkets and government offices, and manage cash flows. 

Since the government started the programme in 2010, the number of small and medium enterprises founded by these housewives has grown from 89 to about 9,500. “Those that do well recruit their neighbours to grow even bigger. Some of them are earning up to 1.6 billion rupiahs (approximately US$107,400) a month now,” said Mayor Rismaharini. 

The Prominent Kampung project, on the other hand, aims to get selected kampungs to focus on producing one excellent item or service each, to build up a brand and competitive advantage in the marketplace. So far, the government has recruited 10 kampungs to produce traditional bags, embroidery, cookies, crackers, shoes, handicrafts, tempeh, tempeh chips, pavement stones and sewing services respectively. 

By tapping on the kampungs’ potential, the government achieved several complementary goals: improving the lives of the city’s poorest residents, adding a potent driver to the economy and highlighting the city’s cultural products. “Developing a city not only involves physical development,” Mayor Rismaharini said about the initiatives in 2017. “It is also about empowering people and making them feel at home.”

| Tri Rismaharini, born in 1961, was elected Mayor of Surabaya in 2010. She belongs to Indonesia’s main opposition Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI-P), whose leader Megawati Sukarnoputri was the country’s president from 2001 to 2004. Prior to becoming Surabaya’s first citizen, Ms Risma, who has a degree in architecture, led the city’s parks department. In that role, she was active in rejuvenating the city’s parks and turning many derelict plots into green spaces. Once described by a Dutch writer as a ‘dirty city full of pretensions and greed’, Surabaya is now known as a ‘million-park’ city. |
