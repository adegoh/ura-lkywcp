***From the “city of cars” to its transformation into a far more human-centric metropolis, the story of Auckland’s urban reinvention illustrates how a city defined by decades of poor quality urban design and infrastructural deficit is able to turn around within ten years to become one of the world’s most liveable cities, through a design-led vision of urban development, strong leadership and championship of good design, and sound urban design policies and projects.***

Auckland today is well on its way to becoming one of the world’s most liveable cities, with urban design playing a leading role in its redevelopment. However, as recent as a decade ago, the city was defined by poor quality urban design – its form and function catering to vehicles rather than people. With one of the highest ownership of cars per capita in the world, the city of sails was more often dubbed “the city of cars”.

In the early 2000s, Auckland finally acted to stem its increasing lack of liveability with the establishment of an urban design panel in 2003 to review development proposals. Recognising that a more coherent, informed approach was needed for Auckland’s reinvention, the city took a critical step forward in 2006 by appointing its first urban design champion to drive better quality, design-led development.

Having helmed successful urban planning and transformation projects in London and Cape Town, Auckland’s first urban design champion, Ludo Campbell-Reid, immediately saw the challenges faced by the city. “When I arrived in 2006, Auckland lacked intensity and density. It was very much designed for rush hour traffic,” Campbell-Reid recalls. “The city felt insecure and lacked a sense of humanity and confidence, yet it was surrounded by the most beautiful landscape on earth. So there was this huge dichotomy where there was this very harsh, bland city in beautiful surroundings.”

Reinventing a car-obsessed city burdened by infrastructural deficits required a long-term strategy to tackle the issue from several fronts. For Auckland, the journey began with placing design first.

“When I arrived in 2006, Auckland lacked intensity and density. It was very much designed for rush hour traffic. […] there was this huge dichotomy where there was this very harsh, bland city in beautiful surroundings.”

Placing design first
Taking inspiration and learning points from design-led cities such as Melbourne and New York, Auckland’s leadership saw the potential catalytic role of good urban design in spurring creativity in its businesses, government and people while creating a more liveable and vibrant environment. Design was thus instituted at the core of Auckland’s urban revitalisation strategy, shaping policies and redevelopment projects – major public and private development proposals now had to go through a design peer review.

Strong leadership and support for design-led initiatives were crucial, as Campbell-Reid notes, “There were a few critical pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. First, you’ve got to have leadership from the very top. I’ve had incredible support, bipartisan support. Design can bridge political and professional divides. I’ve worked with three mayors. When the mayor is behind you, it gives you a sense of confidence. Then you need to appoint a strong design champion, at as high a level in the organisation as possible.”

Auckland’s drive for good design gained stronger momentum by 2010, when the city simplified its governance structure and developed its master plan underpinned by the idea of a design-led city. Landmark projects, such as the redevelopment of the waterfront at Queens Wharf and Wynyard Quarters, the extensive renovation of Auckland Art Gallery and implementation of shared spaces for pedestrians and vehicles in the city centre, reinvigorated the cityscape.

In 2013, the city released the first Auckland Design Manual, a resource for stakeholders in design, building and development to share their guidance and best practices. Within the same year, Auckland approved its public art policy, aimed at incorporating art in public spaces. This string of initiatives within a few years propelled the city’s embrace of sound urban design.
