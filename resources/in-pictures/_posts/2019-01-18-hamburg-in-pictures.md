#### **Catering for a growing city** 

Hamburg is Germany’s second largest city after Berlin with a population of 1.78 million. Once a historic port city, behind only London and New York in terms of import and export volumes before First World War, Hamburg today remains a major port and a global service, media, logistics and industrial hub. In July 2015, Hamburg’s historic warehouse district and its neighbouring counting house district (Speicherstadt and Kontorhausviertel), were listed as world heritage sites by UNESCO. 

Hamburg’s population is growing and expected to reach 1.9 million by 2030. Population growth is driven by birth surplus as well as immigration – young people in particular are moving to Hamburg for job opportunities and further education. As a growing city, Hamburg has to provide sufficient space for housing, office and industrial use, as well as improve its urban mobility.

#### **HafenCity: more city in the city** 

HafenCity is a redevelopment of a former inner-city brownfield site that radically transformed the underused 157 hectares of harbour and industrial space into a dynamic mixed-use district, while complementing the adjacent Speicherstadt district. It is a demonstration of the city’s focus on densification in the built-up area of the city and utilising inner city space more efficiently rather than building on peripheral areas, following the strategy of “More City in the City”. 

HafenCity is a plan-led urban development and one of its major objectives is the urban mix of housing, workplaces and recreational use on a small scale. It deviates from the old model of dedicated office districts, in that there are no single use buildings and users are ‘forced to meet their neighbours’, leading to cohesion and integration. Like all major urban development projects in Hamburg, new projects in HafenCity consist of three equal parts: one third social housing, one third condominiums, and one third privately funded rental housing. This ensures the right conditions for a good social mix and diverse urban neighbourhoods.

#### **A living laboratory of innovative urban solutions** 

After the great storm surge of 1962 that claimed the lives of hundreds of people in Wilhelmsburg in the south of the city – the largest river island in Europe, many residents left the area. In subsequent years this area became a “problem area”. Following a Conference and a policy paper in the 2000s, Hamburg developed the International Building Exhibition (IBA) as a powerful tool to develop and boost the growth of the booming metropolis. 

IBA implemented some 70 innovative projects in the area, many of which are experimental and/or demonstrative in nature, seeking to address the many urban issues that Hamburg and many other cities face today. Similar to that of HafenCity, IBA adopts an integrated holistic approach which is broadly decoupled economically from political budgeting processes.
