#### **Catering for a growing city** 

Hamburg is Germany’s second largest city after Berlin with a population of 1.78 million. Once a historic port city, behind only London and New York in terms of import and export volumes before First World War, Hamburg today remains a major port and a global service, media, logistics and industrial hub. In July 2015, Hamburg’s historic warehouse district and its neighbouring counting house district (Speicherstadt and Kontorhausviertel), were listed as world heritage sites by UNESCO. 

Hamburg’s population is growing and expected to reach 1.9 million by 2030. Population growth is driven by birth surplus as well as immigration – young people in particular are moving to Hamburg for job opportunities and further education. As a growing city, Hamburg has to provide sufficient space for housing, office and industrial use, as well as improve its urban mobility.
