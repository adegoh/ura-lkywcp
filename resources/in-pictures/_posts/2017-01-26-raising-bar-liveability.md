#### **Between the East and West**

Vienna is a historic “Emperor’s city” with over 2 millennia of history, once an important city of the Holy Roman Empire, then the capital of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and now the capital of the Republic of Austria. Following decades of being the eastern “dead end” of Western Europe after the second World War, the city capitalised on the opportunity of the fall of the Iron Curtain in the early 90s to reposition itself as the heart of Europe, with connections to its east and west.

#### **Blue Danube**

Vienna’s urban development evolved with the Danube, one of the biggest rivers of the European continent that runs through the city and 9 other countries in the region. The development of the New Danube and Danube Island, and safeguarding of more than 50% of land areas as green spaces demonstrate not only Vienna’s resolve to maintain a high quality of life in the city, but also to raise the bar by setting the benchmark as an environmentally responsible city to its Danube-sharing neighbours.v
