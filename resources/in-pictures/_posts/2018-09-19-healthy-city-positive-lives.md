#### **Promoting healthy lifestyles**

Kazan recognises that good quality of life begins with a healthy population. The emphasis on sports, medicine and nutrition to improve people’s lives has paid off, with positive indicators such as increased life expectancy and rising birth rates. Beyond the push to encourage its population to adopt healthy lifestyles, Kazan has successfully branded itself as a sports city, hosting international sports events of high standing. The sports events also provide an impetus for urban development and upgrading of existing infrastructure. It is notable that the infrastructure developed do not become post-event white elephants, but world-class facilities utilised by Kazan’s citizens.
