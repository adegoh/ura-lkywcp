description: Seoul used to be a city where urban development is carried out under the mandate of the central government in a rapid fashion, resulting in a low quality of life and an unhappy populace. In the 2000s, Seoul started to implement a series of catalytic projects that helped to reshape the city and align the citizens’ aspirations with its vision. In this photo essay, we look at some of these projects that propelled a new era in Seoul’s city development.

#### **Seoul – before and after**

Seoul is the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea. With a population of 10.2 million in 2016, it is a megacity and the world’s 16th largest city. Seoul experienced a tremendous growth spurt between the 1960s and 2000, with its population increasing from 1.7 million in 1960 to 10.5 million in 2000 (or 6.2 times increase). At the same time, its car population has increased from 8,000 to 2.5 million (or 312.5 times increase). Such a rapid growth over a relatively short period had a great impact on the spatial transformation of the city, at the expense of quality of life.

#### **Cheonggyecheon – before and after**

Following the instatement of local autonomy in the mid-1990s, the city focused on a series of innovative urban regeneration projects that brought about benefits for the entire city. The removal of the ageing Cheonggyecheon highway to restore the stream underneath was the starting point in the city’s efforts in urban regeneration and engaging stakeholders through conflict management strategies in order to realise a common vision.
