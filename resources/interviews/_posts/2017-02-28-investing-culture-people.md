Could you share about the impact to Bilbao of being the first Laureate of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize?

Juan María Aburto (JMA): First of all, I would like to say that the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize has been the most important prize we have received and we are very proud of it, as it is a recognition of our efforts at urban transformation. Winning the Prize has been an enormous opportunity for us to put Bilbao on the map of the world’s most important, dynamic and attractive cities.

But I would like to add as well that our job is not finished yet. We congratulated ourselves but we have not stood still. Instead, we continued working to improve the city and tackle new projects and challenges.

Could you elaborate on some of these new projects?

JMA: One of our main objectives is to consolidate our position as an attractive city for quality tourism. One of Bilbao’s main attractions is our cultural offering, and it is in this area that we offer a unique combination of modernity and tradition.

As you know, our most important cultural icon is the Guggenheim Museum for modern and contemporary art, which opened in 1998 and welcomes more than one million visitors each year. But you must remember that in Bilbao, we have not only modernity and innovation, but also the rich cultural traditions of the Basque Country – one of the most ancient cultures in Europe. It is very important for us to show who we are, our identity and history, and how the Basque Country is like.

For instance, one of our most renowned features is our cuisine and gastronomy: there are only two million people in the Basque Country but we have 30 Michelin-starred restaurants. The opening of the Azkuna Zentroa, named after the former Mayor of Bilbao, the late Iñaki Azkuna (1943 – 2014) is the latest development on our cultural front. This is a major cultural and sports facility for both our population and the more than one million guests we receive every year.
