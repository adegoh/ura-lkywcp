#### **On poverty and local economic development**

**Tri Rismaharini (TR):** After assuming office, I first needed to alleviate the poverty issue in Surabaya. About 20% of the population currently lives in
poverty. Based on available data, I discovered that even though the men in
the family were gainfully employed in jobs such as drivers of Pedi-cabs and
taxis, their families are still poor. As such, there is a need to empower the
housewives in order to improve the domestic economic conditions. The city
government provided these housewives with the necessary training and
means to start their own home businesses, ranging from fashion to food
and handicrafts. We also provide assistance to them in applying for capital
and managing of cash flows.

In addition, the city government also helps to create a market in the
kampungs (traditional villages) for them to sell their products in the
comfort of their own homes. This initiative turns out to be a success, with a
turnover rate of more than 1.6 billion rupiahs (approximately USD
$112,500). As their businesses expand, neighbours are recruited, and this
in turn creates the “Kampung Unggulan” (Prominent Kampung) where
each kampung focuses on producing one unique product such as
embroidery, cookies, batiks, and handicrafts.

| Tri Rismaharini, born in 1961, was elected Mayor of Surabaya in 2010. She belongs to Indonesia’s main opposition Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI-P), whose leader Megawati Sukarnoputri was the country’s president from 2001 to 2004. Prior to becoming Surabaya’s first citizen, Ms Risma, who has a degree in architecture, led the city’s parks department. In that role, she was active in rejuvenating the city’s parks and turning many derelict plots into green spaces. Once described by a Dutch writer as a ‘dirty city full of pretensions and greed’, Surabaya is now known as a ‘million-park’ city. |
