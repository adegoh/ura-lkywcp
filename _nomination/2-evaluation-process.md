All submissions are evaluated through a rigorous two-tier process comprising the Nominating Committee and Prize Council.

- The Nominating Committee reviews and examines submissions and recommends potential Laureates to the Prize Council.
- The Prize Council reviews and selects the Prize Laureate based on the recommendations.
Both panels consist of prominent practitioners, policy makers, academics and experts from a wide range of disciplines in the public and private sectors.
