### **Stage A Nomination**

#### **Who is eligible to nominate?**

Nominations for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize must be made by independent third parties. For a nomination to be valid, here should be at least one nominator who falls into any of the following categories:

- Leading academics (e.g. professors in universities)
- Government officials (outside of the city administration)
- Heads of international organisations in the fields of urban planning, housing, transport management, urban design and architecture, energy conservation, urban policy and management, or other relevant fields.
- Organisations in the public or private sectors
- Non-government organisations (NGOs)
- Academic institutions

Self-nominations **will not be accepted**, i.e. city officials cannot nominate their own city.
