#### **Who can nominate?**

**Who is eligible to nominate?**

Nominations for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize must be made by independent third parties. For a nomination to be valid, here should be at least one nominator who falls into any of the following categories:

- Leading academics (e.g. professors in universities)
- Government officials (outside of the city administration)
- Heads of international organisations in the fields of urban planning, housing, transport management, urban design and architecture, energy conservation, urban policy and management, or other relevant fields.
- Organisations in the public or private sectors
- Non-government organisations (NGOs)
- Academic institutions

Self-nominations will not be accepted, i.e. city officials cannot nominate their own city.

**How many nominations can one nominator make?**

There is no limit to the number of nominations a nominator can make. However, each nomination must be accompanied by a fully completed official nomination form and recommendation letter signed by the nominator.

**Who can I nominate?**

The Prize is awarded to cities and recognises their key leaders and organisations for displaying foresight, good governance and innovation in tackling the many urban challenges faced. You may nominate a city, with the city government taking the lead in the nomination, in association with their key partner organisations (if applicable).

#### **Making the nominations**

**How do I make a Stage A nomination?**

You may make a nomination for a city using the official nomination form. As a nominator, you will be required to submit a recommendation letter to support your case for why the city should win the Prize. Please ensure that the city is agreeable to be nominated.

**How will I know if my nomination is received?**

The nominator and the city will receive an automated e-mail reply to acknowledge the receipt of the nomination. The Prize Secretariat will also follow up shortly on additional information and details required for the city's Stage B submission after verifying the validity of the Stage A nomination.

**Is there an entry fee for making a nomination?**

No.
